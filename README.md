## Features

- **Security Risk Demonstration**: Showcases the threats posed by RATs.
- **Cybersecurity Awareness**: Educates users on good security practices.
- **RESTful API**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for integration and testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- MySQL
- OpenSSL

# Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# SSL Certificate

To generate a self-signed certificate, run the following commands:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

To run the server with the certificate, run the following command:

```bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000 --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
```

# Flask-Migrate

## Initialization of Flask-Migrate

To create the database and tables, run the following commands:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

## Migration

To create a new migration, run the following commands:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description des modifications"
flask db upgrade
```

# Compiling the client

To compile the client, run the following command:

```bash
cd client
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=logo.ico client.py
```

# Generating a Self-Signed Certificate .exe File

**The following commands are to be executed in PowerShell !**

To generate a self-signed certificate .exe file, run the following command:

```bash
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=MySelfSignedCert" -KeySpec Signature -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "password" -Force -AsPlainText
```

This command will return a thumbprint, copy it and replace it in the following command:

```bash
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert "Cert:\CurrentUser\My\<thumbprint>" -FilePath "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\mycert.pfx" -Password $mypwd
```

Then, click here to download Windows SDK which contains signtool.exe: [Windows SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250105)

Finally, run the following command:

```bash
signtool sign /f "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\mycert.pfx" /p "password" /tr "http://timestamp.digicert.com" /td SHA256 /fd SHA256 /v "C:\path\to\client.exe"
```
